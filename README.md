# WRF_installation 
This repository provides documentation on how to compile and install the WRF model, along with the necessary tools. It also outlines the workflow and explains how to set it up for automated, operational model runs. If you are testing WRF on your own computer, check how many CPUs are available. While the model can run on a single core, these instructions are intended for parallel computation. Also, ensure you have sufficient disk space - static geographical data requires approximately 100GB, and the model input/output/temporary files take up a similar amount, depending on your domain. For testing, 200-300GB should be sufficient, while around 1TB is recommended for operational runs.

## Downloading of libraries and compiling of source code
The text file `installation` provides a step-by-step guide on how to install and compile all the needed libraries. Similar instructions are also provided for the WRF source code and its pre/post-processing tools. Following these instructions will ensure that all the necessary binaries for running the WRF model are installed correctly. When running the WRF model or its tools, it is necessary to define some environment variables. These are controlled by `env.sh` which is executed within the model run scripts. Note that in paths (both in installation and `env.sh`), `user` has to be replaced with the correct username. 

## Domain maker
Desired domains for WRF can be easily drawn with [WRF Domain Wizard](https://wrfdomainwizard.net/).

1. Select option "New" from the sidebar and draw the domain on the map. Keep in mind that this will be the outermost domain, which will be calculated with a resolution based on dx/dy (default 12 km).
2. Once you're done, add an inner domain by clicking "Add Nest" and modify it on map.
3. Adjust the resolution of the inner domain by using the "Parent_grid_ratio" setting. The default value is 3, which corresponds to a resolution of 4 km (12 km / 3).
4. To download the finalized domain namelist (namelist.wps) for WRF, click "Save". The information is needed later when configuring WPS running scripts.

## Work flow

### Boundaries
WRF requires boundary files in GRIB format. The script `Download_GFS/get_gfs.sh` is used to download GFS data to the WRF server. The configuration file `Download_GFS/gfs.cnf` specifies the desired GFS area, resolution, valid hours, and other parameters for the download. The paths may need adjustment to work correctly for the specific case. The key is to place the GFS data in the directory specified in the running scripts (default `/home/{user}/WRF_Model/GFS`). Script is always downloading the most recent boundaries.

```
./get_gfs.sh
```

### Preprosessing
In order to use preprocessing tool WPS, a static geographical dataset needs to be downloaded. 
```
wget https://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/src/wps_files/geog_complete.tar.gz .
tar -zxvf geog_complete.tar.gz
```
Along with the mandatory datasets above, additional datasets may be required for specific applications. ([see here](https://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/users/download/get_sources_wps_geog.html#specific))

The next phase involves editing the namelist options in `Run_scripts/Run_WPS.sh`. Update the parameters based on the `namelist.wps` file generated by the WRF Domain Wizard, focusing mainly on domain-related variables, especially those within the geogrid section. Other parameters can be modified as well, but it's important to understand their function. You can find detailed information about the various namelist options in this [link](https://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/users/wrf_users_guide/build/html/wps.html#wps-namelist-variables).

After setting up the namelist parameters, it is necessary to go through the script and modify every path to correspond with the installation and data directories. The WPS run script launches executables in parallel using the mpirun command, so it is important to set the correct number of cores. For example, the command `mpirun -np 24 program.exe` uses 24 CPUs.

WPS setup can be tested from command line by running:
```
./Run_WPS.sh $year $month $day $hour $leadtime $prod_dir
./Run_WPS.sh 2024 09 10 01 00 48 /home/{user}/WRF_Model/out/ 
```
If the script runs successfully, all the necessary input data for the WRF model run should be ready.

### Observations
Observations are essential for data assimilation and verification. Currently, the `get_obs.sh` script gathers observations (primarily satellite radiances) available from the [NCEP real-time data](https://nomads.ncep.noaa.gov/pub/data/nccf/com/obsproc/prod/). The script does not yet support radar or local synoptic observations, as these raw observations need to be processed first into the Little_R format. 

The usage of the script is as follows:
```
./get_obs $year $month $day $hour
```
Note that NCEP real-time data only includes the most recent couple of days.

### The model
Scripts for running the model, possibly DA as well 
### Postprocessing
Unified Post Processor (UPP) can be used to convert WRF NetCDF output to Grib. Instructions how to compile UPP can be found from the `installation`. The text file `setup_upp` describes how to setup UPP as a WRF postprosessing tool and with `Run_scripts/execute_upp.sh` the UPP can be easily used to automated NETCDF -> GRIB conversion.      
### Cleaning and automization
`clean_wrf` script cleans GFS boundary files, WRF and UPP output files.
